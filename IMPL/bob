Design
  Accept string as argument
  Accept string from user in console
CSV of ascii characters
  Load csv into a dictionary
Compare string chars to dictionary keys
    If hit: increment the value of that key
    If miss: add key to array of absent chars
Sort values of dictionary
    Return last three values as top 3 recurring


for (int i = 0; i < csv.Length; i++)
{
	if(key[m] == string[n])	 

Loop through Keys in dictionary

That keyâ€™s value++

If miss, put key into an array then print at end

Print top three
